🎯 Objective

The goal of this lab was to learn the basics of network simulation using GNS3, create simple switch-based network topologies, test connectivity, and use GitHub for documentation and submission.


---

🛠 Tools & Environment

Operating System: Ubuntu

Software: GNS3 (GUI + Local Server)

Devices: VPCS (Virtual PCs), Ethernet Switches

Version Control: GitHub (Public Repository)



---

✅ Tasks Completed

Part A – Installation

Installed GNS3 on Ubuntu

Verified GNS3 Local Server status

Added installation screenshots



---

Part B – Network Topologies

🔹 Topology 1 – Simple LAN

2 PCs + 1 Switch

Assigned IP addresses (same subnet)

Successful ping test


🔹 Topology 2 – Star Topology

4 PCs connected to a central switch

Assigned IP addresses

All devices could communicate


🔹 Topology 3 – Multi-Switch Mesh

3 interconnected switches

1 PC per switch

Same subnet for all PCs

Full end-to-end connectivity verified



---

Part C – Project Export

Exported all topologies as Portable Projects (.zip)

(File → Export → Portable Project)



---

Part D – GitHub Submission

Repository created:
